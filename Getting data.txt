Getting data

Wikipedia uses jQuery on tables, meaning the library gets to be already active on the page and it's possible to use it in console scripts.

The next code snippet when run from Firefox console produces simple data description suitable for copying into .csv file.

$('table.sortable').eq(1).find('tbody > tr').has('td:first[colspan!="2"]').each(function(){
  var dataRow = $(this).find('td');
  var num = $(dataRow).eq(0).text().trim();
  var year = $(dataRow).eq(1).text().trim();
  var capital = $(dataRow).eq(2).text().trim();
console.log("winter;%s;%s;%s;", num, year, capital);
})

For summer games page the same code worked ('winter' changed to 'summer' in the last statement, of course).

There were still some 'the games were cancelled' statements, those I removed by hand.

Cities' coordinates are from Wikipedia's links to GeoHack.

In the final dataset also were made replacements of ', ' to ';' so that city and country, and coordinates are separate.
